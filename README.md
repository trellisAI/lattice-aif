# lattice-aif: AI framework to create Agents

lattice-aif is an agentic framework and platform designed to build, deploy, and manage intelligent AI agents. LatticeAI Engine provides a unified abstraction layer over diverse Large Language Models (LLMs) and external tools, empowering you to create robust, actionable AI solutions with unprecedented flexibility. The client-server architecture is inspired from Docker client and Docker engine, helps to scale and mange the Agents.

## ‚ú® Why lattice-aif?

In a world of fragmented AI capabilities, LatticeAI brings order and efficiency:

* **LLM Agnostic:** Seamlessly integrate and switch between any LLM ‚Äì from cloud-based powerhouses like Google Gemini and OpenAI to local, privacy-focused models like Ollama.
* **Robust Tool-Calling:** Extend LLM capabilities beyond text generation. Connect your agents to any API, database, or internal system to perform real-world actions.
* **Agent Orchestration:** Build complex, multi-step, multi-LLM agent workflows with ease, and manage their entire lifecycle.
* **Lattice Engine:** Inspired by Docker Engine, the arch is designed to benefit from a continuously running, daemonized "Lattice Engine" that provides production-grade reliability, scalability, and resource management for your agents.
* **Developer-Friendly:** Interact via a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) for advanced users, and an intuitive platform for broader adoption (coming soon!).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Dive into the power of LatticeAI. Follow these steps to get your first agent up and running:

1.  **Installation:**
    ```bash
    # Coming soon: A simple pip install or binary download
    # For now, follow the development setup in our documentation.
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/lattice-ai.git](https://github.com/yourusername/lattice-ai.git)
    cd lattice-ai
    # poetry install / pip install -e . (depending on your project setup)
    ```
2.  **Configuration:** Configure your LLM API keys and tool definitions.
    ```bash
    # Example CLI command
    lattice config set openai-api-key sk-...
    lattice config add tool my_crm_api --spec path/to/crm_spec.json
    ```
3.  **Create Your First Agent:**
    ```python

    ```
