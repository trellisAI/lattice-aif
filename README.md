Welcome to Lattice AIF, an AI framework for building intelligent applications.

## Lattice-AIF: New AI framework to create Agents

Lattice-AIF is an agentic framework and platform designed to build, deploy, and manage intelligent AI agents. LatticeAI Engine provides a unified abstraction layer over diverse Large Language Models (LLMs) and external tools, empowering you to create robust, actionable AI solutions with unprecedented flexibility. The client-server architecture is inspired from Docker client and Docker engine, helps to scale and mange the Agents.

## ‚ú® Why Lattice-AIF?

In a world of fragmented AI capabilities, LatticeAI brings order and efficiency:

* **LLM Agnostic:** Seamlessly integrate and switch between any LLM ‚Äì from cloud-based powerhouses like Google Gemini and OpenAI to local, privacy-focused models like Ollama.
* **Robust Tool-Calling:** Extend LLM capabilities beyond text generation. Connect your agents to any API, database, or internal system to perform real-world actions.
* **Agent Orchestration:** Build complex, multi-step, multi-LLM agent workflows with ease, and manage their entire lifecycle.
* **Lattice Engine:** Inspired by Docker Engine, the arch is designed to benefit from a continuously running, daemonized "Lattice Engine" that provides production-grade reliability, scalability, and resource management for your agents.
* **Developer-Friendly:** Interact via a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) for advanced users, and an intuitive platform for broader adoption (coming soon!).


## üöÄ Getting Started

Welcome to the Lattice AIF documentation! This guide will help you get started with the project, including an introduction and installation instructions.

## Introduction

Lattice AIF is an AI framework designed to help you build, deploy, and manage intelligent applications with ease. It provides a robust set of tools to create AI aagents with various capabilities and also seamless integration with your existing workflows.

The client-server architecture enables scalability, modularity, resource optimisation, security and flexibility. This helps to build AI agents at scale with ease.

## Installation

To install Lattice AIF, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trellisAI/lattice-aif.git
cd lattice-aif
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Depending on your environment, follow the instructions below:

#### Server Setup

1. Navigate to the server directory:

   ```bash
   cd lattice-server
   ```

2. Install server dependencies (example using pip for Python):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the following command to start the server (NOT SECURE: WIP)

   ```bash
   python -m LatticePy.latticeai interactive
   ```
   The idea is to have two modes: one interactive and the other a daemon mode, utilising a Unix daemon socket that runs continuously as a backend service. 

more details `docs/details.md` 

#### Client Setup

The client can be directly installed by adding the executable to the PATH.
To download the package, refer to `packages.md`

You can also build locally, refer to the client section `docs/details.md`

### 3. Configuration

Refer to the configuration documentation in the `docs/configuration.md` file for the inital configuration of the set up and get started
